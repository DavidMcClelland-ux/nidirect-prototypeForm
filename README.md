# nidirect-prototypeForm
This is a JavaScript based prototyping kit to create interactive HTML prototypes for [nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/) transactions. 
## Security
If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a username and password. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.
## Getting started
### Step 1: Fork the prototype Form repository
1.	On [GitHub]( https://github.com/), navigate to the [prototype Form]( https://github.com/DavidMcClelland-uxm/nidirect-prototypeForm) repository
2.	In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

### Step 2: create a local clone of your fork
1.	If you haven't yet, you should first [set up Git]( https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git). Don't forget to [set up authentication to GitHub from Git]( https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git) as well.
2.	On GitHub, navigate to **your fork** of the prototype Form repository. 
3.	Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**.

4.	Using the **Clone with HTTPS** option, copy the web URL
5.	Open terminal (on MAC) or Command prompt (on Windows)
6.	Chose the directory on your local machine you want to clone the repository to
    Cd document/repos
7.	Type ````git clone````, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of ````YOUR-USERNAME````:
    Git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nidirect-prototypeForm.git
8.	Press **Enter**. Your local clone will be created.
Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the nidirect-prototypeForm repository.
