# nidirect-prototypeForm
**version 1.0.0**

This is a JavaScript based prototyping kit.

The aim of the kit is to allow designers, with minimal coding skills, to create interactive prototypes for [nidirect]( https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/) services.

Interactive prototypes are good for usability testing because they act like a real application.

Your prototype will help you:

* explore and test design ideas much faster and at lower risk than using code
* ensure your design is the right one for your users before coding


## Security
If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a username and password. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

## Getting started
If you haven't yet, you should first [set up Git]( https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git). Don't forget to [set up authentication to GitHub from Git]( https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git) as well.

### Step 1: Fork the nidirect-prototypeForm repository
1.	On [GitHub]( https://github.com/), navigate to the [nidirect-prototypeForm]( https://github.com/DavidMcClelland-uxm/nidirect-prototypeForm) repository
2.	In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

### Step 2: create a local clone of your fork
1.	On GitHub, navigate to **your fork** of the nidirect-prototypeForm repository. 
2.	Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**.
3.	Using the **Clone with HTTPS** option, copy the web URL
4.	Open terminal (on MAC) or Command prompt (on Windows)
5.	Chose the directory on your local machine you want to clone the repository to

    ```Cd document/repos```    
6.	Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
    It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of `YOUR-USERNAME`:
    
    ```Git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nidirect-prototypeForm.git```
7.	Press **Enter**. Your local clone will be created.

Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the nidirect-prototypeForm repository.
